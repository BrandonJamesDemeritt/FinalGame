# FinalGame
 Game made using pygame for Final


Overall task was to make a game using pygame or tkinter.  I chose pygame.  

Game style had to be approved by professor before hand.  I chose to make a "Shoot-em up" or "SHMUP" style game.  (Galaga, R-Type, Gradius are all examples)

Required to use at least 1 class object, at least 1 loop, and save and read from a file (highscores).
